I politely greeted her with ""Mayng gabii, Maam."" but on a maldita tone, she replied with ""WA JUY MAAYO SA GABII."" I did not mind her since I'm in the zone to party. I couldn't let her ruin our night. Then I asked her how much the tickets are but then again she responded with a condescending tone na ""Kapila na diay ka nakaanhi diri? Nganu mangutana pa man ka?"". As a first timer from Cebu City, I asked politely since one, I honestly don't know how much and two, there could've been special rates since there's an event. Nonetheless, after we secured our tix, we got inside and partied like there's no tomorrow üòä the MAYOR even had a lil chitchat with my friends and welcomedus with glee. Staff like that could ruin an establishment with good vibes. She could've been more friendly.

We occupied a vacant cottage but after a few minutes we were shoved away because apparently the personnel said that was reserved. Unfortunately there was no sign whatsoever that the unit was reserved. But we gave in anyways since they insist. We stayed on the cottage beside the unit. sometime in the afternoon,somebody occupied the unit so we asked them if they were the one who reserved it,but they said no. Towards the end of the day just before we left, we met the group who reserved the unit. And they said they only reserved it for overnight stay. We felt unfairly treated.

We traveled for 5 hours to enjoy the scenery and the pool itself but the power went out for the entirety of our stay.

PahaliResortBasilan,90.4,96.36,36.69,91.5,43.14,16.8,3.75,"Very nice beach, fine white sand. Peaceful. Clean. But food is not worth the price. We booked in a big villa with 4 queen sized bed, but the 6999 is good for 4 only. We still need to pay for an additional 1300 per person. The food is not good. Service crew did not even orient us with the amenities we can use if we book a villa. We just found out before checking out that we can use the kayak for free. If we did not ask, we were not told. Pricy masyado not worth it"
PahaliResortBasilan,45.2,72.27,24.46,54.9,28.76,8.4,2.34,2times na pag book ko dito hindi maganda napaka bagal ng response nila aabutan tayo ng siyam siyam. nakakainis.
PahaliResortBasilan,45.2,72.27,24.46,91.5,28.76,16.8,2.79,"The place itself is beautiful and peaceful.
The very reason I don't recommend this place is that it actually isn't tourist friendly. Sa dami na ng beach at provinces na napuntahan ko d2 lang ako gumastos ng something not worth my money.
I was oblige to pay 600php pra makapasok sa resort for consumable food WITHOUT CHOICES kasi hindi raw ako naka check in guest sa resort. And the serving was actually too small for ""sharing"".
My partner and I wanted to feature this place sana kea we wanted to take pictures lang, experience the fine white sand and blue water. Pro kung gusto daw nMin ng ganun we were allowed just 10mins to take shots, no ligo etc. and that SOUNDS TOO DISAPPOINTING.
Also according to our motor driver there was even a time na hindi na nagtuloy 1 guest nya dahil gulat sya sa presyo, so instead ipinasyal nlng ni kuya driver sa ibang resort.
Also kung walang mag overnight na guest, no walk-in guest is allowed na beyond 5PM.
NOT DIY FRIENDLY."

Seriously, 1,600 for a small cottage overnight? Hindi pa nagana lahat ng sockets. Ibang payment pa if you have a tent. Gusto sana naming hindi na matuloy the day we went there kasi sobrang layo ng price nung booking compared sa actual meeting with their rep, kaso sobrang layo na nang binyahe namin. We were so disappointed. Not the best customer service also, pwera na lang kay kuyang guard and one of their picnic area staff. Yun lang, overall the resort was far from being okay.

Entrance fee 100 per head
Cottage 800

We went at your resort to have a pleasant stay with our family, to relax and unwind. But what we have experienced was a disaster.

The place is full of flies, parang bag bebreed ung mga langaw.

The resort is not organized, walang tubig ang toilets, madaming pusa at aso (nakagat ako)

I was bitten by a cat, there are more than 4 cats around. I informed the girl (maintanance at the gate). Sabi nila, hindi daw sakanila ung mga pusa in short ‚Äúpusang gala‚Äù ung kumagat saakin.. then why its even in your gated property? Paano pag may rabies yun tapos kumagat pa ng ibang visitor?

Ung mga foods namin puno ng langaw, nag bigay sila isang candle which is not enough kasi thousands talaga ang mga langaw parang basurahan ung place.

Ung tubig sobrang kati. üò≠üò≠

I have the right to complain especially more than 15 people kami na nag bayad ng 100 each at ung cottage nyong 800 na di namin maupuan or tambayan kasi puno ng langaw.

Bawal daw mag swimming yung taong may ganyan. Pasalamat kayo wala kayo ganyan. FYI hindi po contagious mga yan. Aral muna kayo. Sa genes yan. Kaya hindi dapat pandirihan. Kahit mga Hollywood star or anak ng mga artista like team Kramer may skin allergy anak nila.

woodlandresort,67.8,48.18,12.23,73.2,28.76,16.8,2.47,Impolite staffs. They have new policy on accepting guest but they did not provide notice  to the public that they are no longer accepting children which is contradicting to their post in which they still include the children rate. Nag commute lang kami and upon arrival they still waited for our service to go before informing us of their new policy. Hussle tlga kasi from the start wala silang binibigay na public adisory but they have lots of pics posted with children. Ang layo pa saan mkakahanap ng vehicle and even assisting nlng since may kasama kaming senior and bata wala. Bad management!

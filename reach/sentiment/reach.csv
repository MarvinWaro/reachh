100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Not good...water heater is not functioning, No TV station...not worth the price. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"What a huge disappointment! They don't give complete details about the reservation and payment policy. We made a reservation (for overnight stay) and have already prepared our budget based on the prices they provided but when we arrived at the resort, turned out there are different charges, which we were not informed. We had no choice because it was already late evening and we're already there. Lost all our energy during the overnight stay.. Crazy experience!! Ang mahal mahal ng cottage tapos iba pa presyo pag gabi. Limited lang pa talaga ang access.. daming extra charges for this and that 👎🏻 Hope this won't happen again. (Coz definitely, hindi na kami babalik!!)"
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Based sa naexpirience ko. HINDI accommodating, HINDI hospitable ang mga WORKERS nila. HINDI malinis ang paligid. maraming pupu ng dog.
So disappointed."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Though they have poor customer service, but still the beach is amazing."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Me and my friends had the worst experience booking this place. We went there to unwind and enjoy but we get the opposite. Yes, ganun ka worst. Hindi po malinaw yung instructions and policy nila sa payment. Ang daming binabayaran, kapag nag overnight ka and stay over 7am, ibang entrance nanaman. Ang mamahal pa ng cottages. Seriously, 1,600 for a small cottage overnight? Hindi pa nagana lahat ng sockets. Ibang payment pa if you have a tent. Gusto sana naming hindi na matuloy the day we went there kasi sobrang layo ng price nung booking compared sa actual meeting with their rep, kaso sobrang layo na nang binyahe namin. We were so disappointed. Not the best customer service also, pwera na lang kay kuyang guard and one of their picnic area staff. Yun lang, overall the resort was far from being okay. We just had to maximize our payment pero never again."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"DISAPPOINTED : EXPECTATIONS NOT MET!!!
 - Booked 2 new Villas not worth ,its pricy - water from the faucets are very dirty muddy /sandy toilets are filty. 
Customer service needs improvements ."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"The customer service, especially on online bookings, is very poor. We’ve tried booking and inquiring for days and yet, it is still unsuccessful. They don’t even answer the calls or questions we are sending through messages. We had to ask someone to book directly just to make it possible. I hope you can improve on this matter. Even until now, we still have no response, just automated messages."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,Poor customer service. Hindi sumasagot sa calls and chats.
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,Their Staff are so friendly and they are already secured in everything
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,the staffs are accommodating and the atmosphere is nice
100064329572985,people,"Pag uwi naman galing Danmar, sobrang kati ng katawan namin"
100064329572985,people,"sobrang mahal. sobrang dumi, esp cr"
100064329572985,people,"I didn't go there myself but my friends went and we were on a call together. The resort is not worth going to.
The pools were not well maintained (One pool was green and mossy, and the other was yellow), the beach was not clean, and the same goes for the bathrooms and shower rooms, making the expensive entrance not worth the price and they didn't even get to swim because of how dirty it was. The environment looks nice but it doesn't really make up for it since it's advertised as a beach resort, not a park."
100064329572985,people,Highly recommended resort. really cool ambiance... peaceful place... try to visit dan mar
100064329572985,people,nice and Worth it highly recommended😍🥰

100064329572985,people,"Cr so dirty, no soap. Super barado ang cr. Surroundings full of trash."
100064329572985,people,"malumot na yung side ng adult pool and madumi yung water.. kailangan pa namin magreklamo den naglinis na cla. yung bubong ng cottages paayos na din po kasi my mga butas butas na.. add na dn po sila ng shower area and cr na dn po. on d other hand, i think the place is nice and air is fresh. thumb ups also to ur kiddie pool, d kids enjoyed it! cleanliness lang po tlaga and for sure people wil come and flock ur resort.  thanks!"

100063941023937,thebeachhouseatwestcoastpatalon,Pangit lang ng rules nila. Masyado nila dinadown yung mga taong may psoriasis at other skin allergies. Bawal daw mag swimming yung taong may ganyan. Pasalamat kayo wala kayo ganyan. FYI hindi po contagious mga yan. Aral muna kayo. Sa genes yan. Kaya hindi dapat pandirihan. Kahit mga Hollywood star or anak ng mga artista like team Kramer may skin allergy anak nila.
100063941023937,thebeachhouseatwestcoastpatalon,Super ganda worth it tlga sha! ❤️❤️❤️
100063941023937,thebeachhouseatwestcoastpatalon,"Ayusin nyo po reservation/booking process  nyo! Our  team already got confirmation from you. When we were about to pay the reservation fee, nabigay na raw sa iba yung particular date. Nakakita lang kayo ng pera, nasilaw agad!

100079326946930,vistadelmarresortzamboanga,"The ambiance is beautiful. We enjoyed staying there to wait for the sunset and had dinner. Masarap ang food nila and the staff are very polite and accomodating. Just maybe the beach needs improvement, medyu di magandang tingnan yung mga kalat sa beach..pero konti lang naman. All in all we loved the stay there. ��"

100063647214137,people,"FYI Skyview Resort at San Roque / Skyview Resort, Sanroque Zamboanga City / Skyview Resort & Restaurant/ Skyview Resorts

Entrance fee 100 per head
Cottage 800

We went at your resort to have a pleasant stay with our family, to relax and unwind. But what we have experienced was a disaster.

The place is full of flies, parang bag bebreed ung mga langaw.

The resort is not organized, walang tubig ang toilets, madaming pusa at aso (nakagat ako)

I was bitten by a cat, there are more than 4 cats around. I informed the girl (maintanance at the gate). Sabi nila, hindi daw sakanila ung mga pusa in short “pusang gala” ung kumagat saakin.. then why its even in your gated property? Paano pag may rabies yun tapos kumagat pa ng ibang visitor?

Ung mga foods namin puno ng langaw, nag bigay sila isang candle which is not enough kasi thousands talaga ang mga langaw parang basurahan ung place.

Ung tubig sobrang kati. 😭😭

I have the right to complain especially more than 15 people kami na nag bayad ng 100 each at ung cottage nyong 800 na di namin maupuan or tambayan kasi puno ng langaw.

I do not recommend this resort at all."

100064535508135,woodlandresort,Bad costumer service and incomplete menu.
100064535508135,woodlandresort,Impolite staffs. They have new policy on accepting guest but they did not provide notice  to the public that they are no longer accepting children which is contradicting to their post in which they still include the children rate. Nag commute lang kami and upon arrival they still waited for our service to go before informing us of their new policy. Hussle tlga kasi from the start wala silang binibigay na public adisory but they have lots of pics posted with children. Ang layo pa saan mkakahanap ng vehicle and even assisting nlng since may kasama kaming senior and bata wala. Bad management!
100064535508135,woodlandresort,"The resort has safe and clean pools for the kids. Foods are delicious and the staff are friendly. Open cottages are affordable and spacious, with wide and clean yards. Over-all housekeeping in the resort is commendable. We are planning to be back soon. 😀😀😀"
100064535508135,woodlandresort,But no slides for children and adults to have more fun..no foods and drinks kaya no plan to  visit back..

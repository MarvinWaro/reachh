100063667789014,DonelBeachResort,"The place is awesome and the party last sat nyt was lit af. However, the short, fat ticketing staff was so rude that I couldn't understand why. I politely greeted her with ""Mayng gabii, Maam."" but on a maldita tone, she replied with ""WA JUY MAAYO SA GABII."" I did not mind her since I'm in the zone to party. I couldn't let her ruin our night. Then I asked her how much the tickets are but then again she responded with a condescending tone na ""Kapila na diay ka nakaanhi diri? Nganu mangutana pa man ka?"". As a first timer from Cebu City, I asked politely since one, I honestly don't know how much and two, there could've been special rates since there's an event. Nonetheless, after we secured our tix, we got inside and partied like there's no tomorrow 😊 the MAYOR even had a lil chitchat with my friends and welcomedus with glee. Staff like that could ruin an establishment with good vibes. She could've been more friendly. I still wanna comeback if given the chance but I hope she'll be reassigned in the kitchen where no one's gonna interact with her 😂"
100063667789014,DonelBeachResort,"nice place,  always happy"

100064104934800,EribertaSpringsOfficial,"Pls clean the surroundings, side walks it's very slippery. They are collecting entrance fees so it's just right they have to maintain the cleanliness. We were there last December 27, stray dogs were inside too, as we were eating we smelled dogs feces. Ang daming lumot."

100064104934800,EribertaSpringsOfficial,"Had a bad management experience in this resort during our visit which definitely will be the last one. We occupied a vacant cottage but after a few minutes we were shoved away because apparently the personnel said that was reserved. Unfortunately there was no sign whatsoever that the unit was reserved. But we gave in anyways since they insist. We stayed on the cottage beside the unit. sometime in the afternoon,somebody occupied the unit so we asked them if they were the one who reserved it,but they said no. Towards the end of the day just before we left, we met the group who reserved the unit. And they said they only reserved it for overnight stay. We felt unfairly treated. I dont know about you but thats not how you treat customers. First impressions always last."

100063717441076,caluaninfinitypool,"We are very disappointed! We traveled for 5 hours to enjoy the scenery and the pool itself but the power went out for the entirety of our stay. Instead of accommodating us for the power outage, we were left mostly to our own devices. The room itself was very hot and full of mosquitoes, we did not have enough beeds, pillows and blankets. The scenery was nice and the pool was better."

100068324346973,PahaliResortBasilan,"Very nice beach, fine white sand. Peaceful. Clean. But food is not worth the price. We booked in a big villa with 4 queen sized bed, but the 6999 is good for 4 only. We still need to pay for an additional 1300 per person. The food is not good. Service crew did not even orient us with the amenities we can use if we book a villa. We just found out before checking out that we can use the kayak for free. If we did not ask, we were not told. Pricy masyado not worth it"
100068324346973,PahaliResortBasilan,2times na pag book ko dito hindi maganda napaka bagal ng response nila aabutan tayo ng siyam siyam. nakakainis.
100068324346973,PahaliResortBasilan,"The place itself is beautiful and peaceful.
The very reason I don't recommend this place is that it actually isn't tourist friendly. Sa dami na ng beach at provinces na napuntahan ko d2 lang ako gumastos ng something not worth my money.
I was oblige to pay 600php pra makapasok sa resort for consumable food WITHOUT CHOICES kasi hindi raw ako naka check in guest sa resort. And the serving was actually too small for ""sharing"".
My partner and I wanted to feature this place sana kea we wanted to take pictures lang, experience the fine white sand and blue water. Pro kung gusto daw nMin ng ganun we were allowed just 10mins to take shots, no ligo etc. and that SOUNDS TOO DISAPPOINTING.
Also according to our motor driver there was even a time na hindi na nagtuloy 1 guest nya dahil gulat sya sa presyo, so instead ipinasyal nlng ni kuya driver sa ibang resort.
Also kung walang mag overnight na guest, no walk-in guest is allowed na beyond 5PM.

I inbox Dr Aire after scrolling through his page, the doctor responded nicely and told me that he is going to ship the cure medications to me via a shipping company, he also said I am going to get cured within. two to three weeks! I never doubted him because many have said so much good news about his herbal medicine on every site and everything really went as planned.. His herbal treatments are completely legit and I recommend you contact him on drairehome@gmail.com or WhatsApp his number on +2347036740271"

100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Not good...water heater is not functioning, No TV station...not worth the price. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"What a huge disappointment! They don't give complete details about the reservation and payment policy. We made a reservation (for overnight stay) and have already prepared our budget based on the prices they provided but when we arrived at the resort, turned out there are different charges, which we were not informed. We had no choice because it was already late evening and we're already there. Lost all our energy during the overnight stay.. Crazy experience!! Ang mahal mahal ng cottage tapos iba pa presyo pag gabi. Limited lang pa talaga ang access.. daming extra charges for this and that 👎🏻 Hope this won't happen again. (Coz definitely, hindi na kami babalik!!)"
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Based sa naexpirience ko. HINDI accommodating, HINDI hospitable ang mga WORKERS nila. HINDI malinis ang paligid. maraming pupu ng dog.
So disappointed."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Though they have poor customer service, but still the beach is amazing."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"Me and my friends had the worst experience booking this place. We went there to unwind and enjoy but we get the opposite. Yes, ganun ka worst. Hindi po malinaw yung instructions and policy nila sa payment. Ang daming binabayaran, kapag nag overnight ka and stay over 7am, ibang entrance nanaman. Ang mamahal pa ng cottages. Seriously, 1,600 for a small cottage overnight? Hindi pa nagana lahat ng sockets. Ibang payment pa if you have a tent. Gusto sana naming hindi na matuloy the day we went there kasi sobrang layo ng price nung booking compared sa actual meeting with their rep, kaso sobrang layo na nang binyahe namin. We were so disappointed. Not the best customer service also, pwera na lang kay kuyang guard and one of their picnic area staff. Yun lang, overall the resort was far from being okay. We just had to maximize our payment pero never again."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"DISAPPOINTED : EXPECTATIONS NOT MET!!!
 - Booked 2 new Villas not worth ,its pricy - water from the faucets are very dirty muddy /sandy toilets are filty. 
Customer service needs improvements ."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,"The customer service, especially on online bookings, is very poor. We’ve tried booking and inquiring for days and yet, it is still unsuccessful. They don’t even answer the calls or questions we are sending through messages. We had to ask someone to book directly just to make it possible. I hope you can improve on this matter. Even until now, we still have no response, just automated messages."
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,Poor customer service. Hindi sumasagot sa calls and chats.
100069111910985,azzurabeachresort,Their Staff are so friendly and they are already secured in everything

100064329572985,people,"sobrang mahal. sobrang dumi, esp cr"
100064329572985,people,"I didn't go there myself but my friends went and we were on a call together. The resort is not worth going to.
The pools were not well maintained (One pool was green and mossy, and the other was yellow), the beach was not clean, and the same goes for the bathrooms and shower rooms, making the expensive entrance not worth the price and they didn't even get to swim because of how dirty it was. The environment looks nice but it doesn't really make up for it since it's advertised as a beach resort, not a park."
100064329572985,people,Highly recommended resort. really cool ambiance... peaceful place... try to visit dan mar

100063941023937,thebeachhouseatwestcoastpatalon,Pangit lang ng rules nila. Masyado nila dinadown yung mga taong may psoriasis at other skin allergies. Bawal daw mag swimming yung taong may ganyan. Pasalamat kayo wala kayo ganyan. FYI hindi po contagious mga yan. Aral muna kayo. Sa genes yan. Kaya hindi dapat pandirihan. Kahit mga Hollywood star or anak ng mga artista like team Kramer may skin allergy anak nila.
100063941023937,thebeachhouseatwestcoastpatalon,Super ganda worth it tlga sha! ❤️❤️❤️
100063941023937,thebeachhouseatwestcoastpatalon,"Ayusin nyo po reservation/booking process  nyo! Our  team already got confirmation from you. When we were about to pay the reservation fee, nabigay na raw sa iba yung particular date. Nakakita lang kayo ng pera, nasilaw agad!

100063848078771,monteverderesort,Highly recommended ang resort. Binook namin is Choco House for overnight stay. House is huge with 2 rooms. Everything is great. Malinis ang pool and nasaktuhan na wala masyadong tao so we really enjoyed our swimming. The price is just right and most of all mababait ang mga tao (staff.) Great place for people gathering.

100063647214137,people,"FYI Skyview Resort at San Roque / Skyview Resort, Sanroque Zamboanga City / Skyview Resort & Restaurant/ Skyview Resorts

Entrance fee 100 per head
Cottage 800

We went at your resort to have a pleasant stay with our family, to relax and unwind. But what we have experienced was a disaster.

The place is full of flies, parang bag bebreed ung mga langaw.

The resort is not organized, walang tubig ang toilets, madaming pusa at aso (nakagat ako)

I was bitten by a cat, there are more than 4 cats around. I informed the girl (maintanance at the gate). Sabi nila, hindi daw sakanila ung mga pusa in short “pusang gala” ung kumagat saakin.. then why its even in your gated property? Paano pag may rabies yun tapos kumagat pa ng ibang visitor?

Ung mga foods namin puno ng langaw, nag bigay sila isang candle which is not enough kasi thousands talaga ang mga langaw parang basurahan ung place.

Ung tubig sobrang kati. 😭😭

I have the right to complain especially more than 15 people kami na nag bayad ng 100 each at ung cottage nyong 800 na di namin maupuan or tambayan kasi puno ng langaw.

I do not recommend this resort at all."
100063966816643,people,Its a very satisfying feeling to be like in your own home when you stay in this resort!!!
100063966816643,people,"What I like most about Sunrise Family Resort aside from the place, house, pool, and ktv room are also the staffs and the owner who are very attentive and very friendly. I really recommend the place because you will feel that you are away from the city and you have the time to unwind and bond with your family and friends."
100063966816643,people,"The place is so cozy, homy, highly recommended for Family gatherings,class reunions, Birthdays, and many others , just see it yourself 👍👍😜"

100064535508135,woodlandresort,Bad costumer service and incomplete menu.
100064535508135,woodlandresort,Impolite staffs. They have new policy on accepting guest but they did not provide notice  to the public that they are no longer accepting children which is contradicting to their post in which they still include the children rate. Nag commute lang kami and upon arrival they still waited for our service to go before informing us of their new policy. Hussle tlga kasi from the start wala silang binibigay na public adisory but they have lots of pics posted with children. Ang layo pa saan mkakahanap ng vehicle and even assisting nlng since may kasama kaming senior and bata wala. Bad management!
100064535508135,woodlandresort,"The resort has safe and clean pools for the kids. Foods are delicious and the staff are friendly. Open cottages are affordable and spacious, with wide and clean yards. Over-all housekeeping in the resort is commendable. We are planning to be back soon. 😀😀😀"
100064535508135,woodlandresort,But no slides for children and adults to have more fun..no foods and drinks kaya no plan to  visit back..
100064535508135,woodlandresort,"Nice resort....I loved it,  I really like the views, it is my first time to see the resort."
100064535508135,woodlandresort,Ganda ng place nkahanap din ng solemn na resort pra mka rest at the same time mag enjoy.  nice din yung swimming pool. Ang sarap ng mga foods. Good atmosphere ng room nila.
100064535508135,woodlandresort,it's a nice place & views.but I hope you would be open for others foods & snacks to bring what I mean is sana pwd magdala kahit konting snacks lang tulad ng chichirya.
100064535508135,woodlandresort,Super nice and clean :)

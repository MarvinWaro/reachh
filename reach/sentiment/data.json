We made a reservation (for overnight stay) and have already prepared our budget based on the prices they provided but when we arrived at the resort, turned out there are different charges, which we were not informed. We had no choice because it was already late evening and we're already there. Lost all our energy during the overnight stay.. Crazy experience!! Ang mahal mahal ng cottage tapos iba pa presyo pag gabi. Limited lang pa talaga ang access.. daming extra charges for this and that \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb Hope this won't happen again.

Hindi po malinaw yung instructions and policy nila sa payment. Ang daming binabayaran, kapag nag overnight ka and stay over 7am, ibang entrance nanaman. Ang mamahal pa ng cottages. Seriously, 1,600 for a small cottage overnight? Hindi pa nagana lahat ng sockets. Ibang payment pa if you have a tent. Gusto sana naming hindi na matuloy the day we went there kasi sobrang layo ng price nung booking compared sa actual meeting with their rep, kaso sobrang layo na nang binyahe namin. We were so disappointed. Not the best customer service also, pwera na lang kay kuyang guard and one of their picnic area staff. Yun lang, overall the resort was far from being okay. We just had to maximize our payment pero never again."

Hussle tlga kasi from the start wala silang binibigay na public adisory but they have lots of pics posted with children.

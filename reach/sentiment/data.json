I politely greeted her with \"Mayng gabii, Maam.\" but on a maldita tone, she replied with \"WA JUY MAAYO SA GABII.\" I did not mind her since I'm in the zone to party. I couldn't let her ruin our night. Then I asked her how much the tickets are but then again she responded with a condescending tone na \"Kapila na diay ka nakaanhi diri? Nganu mangutana pa man ka?\". As a first timer from Cebu City, I asked politely since one, I honestly don't know how much and two, there could've been special rates since there's an event. Nonetheless, after we secured our tix, we got inside and partied like there's no tomorrow \ud83d\ude0a the MAYOR even had a lil chitchat with my friends and welcomedus with glee. Staff like that could ruin an establishment with good vibes. She could've been more friendly. I still wanna comeback if given the chance but I hope she'll be reassigned in the kitchen where no one's gonna interact with her \ud83d\ude02"

Unfortunately there was no sign whatsoever that the unit was reserved. But we gave in anyways since they insist. We stayed on the cottage beside the unit. sometime in the afternoon,somebody occupied the unit so we asked them if they were the one who reserved it,but they said no. Towards the end of the day just before we left, we met the group who reserved the unit. And they said they only reserved it for overnight stay. We felt unfairly treated.

Sa dami na ng beach at provinces na napuntahan ko d2 lang ako gumastos ng something not worth my money.\nI was oblige to pay 600php pra makapasok sa resort for consumable food WITHOUT CHOICES kasi hindi raw ako naka check in guest sa resort. And the serving was actually too small for \"sharing\".\nMy partner and I wanted to feature this place sana kea we wanted to take pictures lang, experience the fine white sand and blue water. Pro kung gusto daw nMin ng ganun we were allowed just 10mins to take shots, no ligo etc. and that SOUNDS TOO DISAPPOINTING.\nAlso according to our motor driver there was even a time na hindi na nagtuloy 1 guest nya dahil gulat sya sa presyo, so instead ipinasyal nlng ni kuya driver sa ibang resort.\nAlso kung walang mag overnight na guest, no walk-in guest is allowed na beyond 5PM.\nNOT DIY FRIENDLY."

We had no choice because it was already late evening and we're already there. Lost all our energy during the overnight stay.. Crazy experience!! Ang mahal mahal ng cottage tapos iba pa presyo pag gabi. Limited lang pa talaga ang access.. daming extra charges for this and that \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb Hope this won't happen again.

Hindi po malinaw yung instructions and policy nila sa payment. Ang daming binabayaran, kapag nag overnight ka and stay over 7am, ibang entrance nanaman. Ang mamahal pa ng cottages. Seriously, 1,600 for a small cottage overnight? Hindi pa nagana lahat ng sockets. Ibang payment pa if you have a tent. Gusto sana naming hindi na matuloy the day we went there kasi sobrang layo ng price nung booking compared sa actual meeting with their rep, kaso sobrang layo na nang binyahe namin. We were so disappointed. Not the best customer service also, pwera na lang kay kuyang guard and one of their picnic area staff. Yun lang, overall the resort was far from being okay. We just had to maximize our payment pero never again."

But what we have experienced was a disaster.\n\nThe place is full of flies, parang bag bebreed ung mga langaw.\n\nThe resort is not organized, walang tubig ang toilets, madaming pusa at aso (nakagat ako)\n\nI was bitten by a cat, there are more than 4 cats around. I informed the girl (maintanance at the gate). Sabi nila, hindi daw sakanila ung mga pusa in short \u201cpusang gala\u201d ung kumagat saakin.. then why its even in your gated property? Paano pag may rabies yun tapos kumagat pa ng ibang visitor?\n\nUng mga foods namin puno ng langaw, nag bigay sila isang candle which is not enough kasi thousands talaga ang mga langaw parang basurahan ung place.\n\nUng tubig sobrang kati. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nI have the right to complain especially more than 15 people kami na nag bayad ng 100 each at ung cottage nyong 800 na di namin maupuan or tambayan kasi puno ng langaw.\n\nI do not recommend this resort at all."
